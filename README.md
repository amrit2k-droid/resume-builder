# Resume-Builder App
In  this project, I have created a resume-builder webapp using React and Redux in which user can provide details like
basic info, work-ex info, projects etc. Henceforth, the user can preview the resume built and can edit each section
individually. The user can also save the resume as a pdf and use it.

## Packages used
 ### React-Redux
  #### used npm install -save react-redux for downloading 
 ### Redux
  #### used npm install --save redux for downloading 
 ### React-Router
  #### used npm install --save react-router react-router-dom for downloading
  
 #### npm start to start the webapp.
